What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, the computer creates a .git folder that will store info from future commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area offers a place that tells you what will happen in the future IF you commit. This means that it allows you a preview of what will happen when you commit without having you actually conduct the commit.
